        <h5>What to Build</h5>
        <p>Your project must be built using Agent Development Kit and you must focus on the design and orchestration of
          interactions between multiple agents using ADK (Python or Java version). Build your solutions within one of
          the
          following categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b> Automation of Complex Processes:</b> Design multi-agent workflows to automate complex, multi-step
            business processes, software development lifecycle, or manage intricate tasks.</li>
          <li><b>Data Analysis and Insights: </b>Create multi-agent systems that autonomously analyze data from
            various sources, derive meaningful insights using tools like BigQuery, and collaboratively present findings.
          </li>
          <li><b>Customer Service and Engagement: </b>Develop intelligent virtual assistants or support agents
            built with ADK as multi-agent systems to handle complex customer inquiries, provide personalized support,
            and
            proactively engage with customers.</li>
          <li><b>Content Creation and Generation:</b> Build multi-agent systems that can autonomously generate
            different forms of content, such as marketing materials, reports, or code, by orchestrating agents with
            specialized content generation capabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your project must be built using Agent Development Kit and you must focus on the design and orchestration of
          interactions between multiple agents using ADK. While ADK is foundational, you are allowed and encouraged to
          enhance your solutions by integrating with other relevant technologies and frameworks within the Google Cloud
          ecosystem.</p>
        <p>The project must be capable of being successfully installed and must function as depicted in the video and/or
          expressed in the text description.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h5>What to Submit</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Include a URL to the hosted Project for judging and testing.</li>
          <li>Include a text description that includes a summary of the Project‚Äôs features and functionality,
            technologies
            used, information about any other data sources used, and your findings and learnings as you worked through
            the
            project. Written parts of entries must be in English to be eligible.&nbsp; The Submission must, at a
            minimum,
            support English language use.</li>
          <li>Include a URL to your public code repository to show how your project was built. The code repository must
            be
            public to allow access for judging and testing. By submitting this code, you confirm you have the authority
            and
            right to share the code for the purposes described in this Contest.</li>
          <li>Include an Architecture Diagram showing which technologies were used and how they interact with one
            another.
          </li>
          <li>Include a demonstration video of your Project. The video portion of the submission must meet the following
            criteria:
