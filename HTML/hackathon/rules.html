            the purpose of adding, removing or replacing material that potentially infringes a third party mark or
            right, discloses personally identifiable information, or is otherwise inappropriate. The modified
            Submission must remain substantively the same as the original Submission with the only modification
            being what the Sponsor and Devpost permits.</p>

            baseline level of viability, in that the Submission includes all Submission requirements, reasonably
            addresses a Challenge and reasonably applies the requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Stage Two:</strong> All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two by the
            Judges based on the following weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of
            the Judges. Each Submission will receive a score from 1 to 5 per criteria and those criteria scores will
            be averaged per Submission.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Technical Implementation (50%): </strong>How well is the solution technically executed? Is
                the code clean, efficient, and well-documented? How effectively does the project utilize the core
                concepts of Agent Development Kit? Did the project showcase the use of multiple AI agents working
                together to achieve tasks?

            <li>
                <strong>Innovation and Creativity (30%):</strong> How novel and original is the idea? Does it
                address a significant problem or create a unique solution?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Demo and Documentation (20%):</strong> Is the problem clearly defined, and is the solution
                effectively presented through a demo and documentation? Have they explained how they used Agent
                Development Kit and relevant tools? Have they included an architectural diagram?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each Submission will receive a score from 1 to 5 (Stage Two Score), with the highest possible Stage Two

        <p><strong>Stage Three: </strong>The Submissions that pass Stage One and Two will be evaluated based the
            following:</p>
        <p><strong>Bonus Developer Contributions: </strong>Did they provide complete and relevant optional Developer
            Contributions? See Optional Developer Contributions in Section 6.B.</p>
        <p>If the Submission includes complete and requested optional Developer Contributions (a), a maximum of 0.4
            points will be added to the Stage Two Score. If the Submission includes complete and requested optional
            Developer Contributions (b), a maximum of 0.4 will be added to the Stage Two Score. If the Submission
            includes complete and requested optional Developer Contributions (c), a maximum 0.2 will be added to the
            Stage Two Score. Each Submission will receive Final score from 1 to 6, with the highest possible Final
            score being 6.</p>
        <p>The highest-scoring Submission for each region will be selected as the potential winner(s), The
            highest-scoring Submission for each region (North America, Latin America, Europe-Middle East-Africa,
            Asia Pacific) will be selected as the potential winner(s), and the highest-scoring Submission across all
            regions will win the Grand Prize. Ties will be broken by comparing scores on each criterion in the order
            listed, and if a tie remains, judges will vote. If a potential winner is disqualified, the Submission
            with the next highest score will become the potential winner.</p>
        <p>On or about <strong>July 9, 2025</strong>, the potential winner(s) will be selected and may be notified
            by email, at Sponsor’s discretion for Winner Verification Requirement (as defined below). If a potential
            winner does not respond to the notification attempt within two days from the first notification attempt,
            then such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate potential winner will be selected from
            among all eligible entries received based on the judging criteria described herein.&nbsp; Except where
            prohibited by law, each potential winner may be required to sign and return a Declaration of Eligibility
            and Liability and Publicity Release and provide any additional information that may be required by
            Sponsor.&nbsp; If required, potential winners must return all such required documents within two days
            following attempted notification or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and
            another potential winner will be selected based on the judging criteria described herein. All
            notification requirements, as well as other requirements within these Rules, will be strictly enforced.
        </p>
        <p>“Winner Verification Requirement” means THE AWARD OF A PRIZE TO A POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO
            VERIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND ROLE OF THE POTENTIAL WINNER IN THE CREATION OF THE
            SUBMISSION. No Submission or individual shall be deemed a winning Submission or winner until their
            post-competition prize affidavits have been completed and verified, even if prospective winners have
            been announced verbally or on the competition website. The final decision to designate a winner shall be
            made by the Sponsor and/or Administrator.</p>
        <p>A Submission can win a maximum of one prize. In the event that no entries are received for a region, no
            prize will be awarded. Determinations of judges are final and binding.</p>
